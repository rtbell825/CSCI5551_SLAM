# CSCI5551_SLAM

This file contains the code needed to run my SLAM robot. This code currently compiles but requires too much dynamic memory to run successfully on an Arduino Uno. 

EKF portion is based off the work done in this project: https://github.com/snmnmin12/ekf-slam/blob/master/src/ekfslam.cpp
